The challenge asks me to invoke my first command with arguments.
### My solve
**Flag** `pwn.college{EPjZ9b8O36EKfYF1CmOoasta5KE.QX4YjM1wCMyEzNzEzW}`

## Comand history
The challenge asks me to scroll through the histroy of saved commands.
### My solve
**Flag** `pwn.college{wNWN4Is9szRnXia3DmaYexYwPv5.0lNzEzNxwCMyEzNzEzW}`
```bash
We type a lot of commands, and typing everything from scratch can be annoying.
So, shell saves a history of every command you invoke.
Here,i had to get my history using the up arrow key for the flag.
```
### What I learned
I learned that we can scroll through saved commands with the up/down arrow keys
