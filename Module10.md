The challenge asks me to invoke my first command.
### My solve
**Flag** `pwn.college{ciGr-djk4yLVMNbKT16ixWV-mQX.QX3YjM1wCMyEzNzEzW}`
```
A command line contains a program name and parameters to the program seperated by spaces.
When we type a command and hit enter, the command gets invoked.
Here,i wrote hello and got a flag.
