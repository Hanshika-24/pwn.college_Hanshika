# Digesting Documentation
## learning from documentation
The challenge teaches me reading from documentation.
**Flag** `pwn.college{4FYb1LmJPPJMmPuCWYiOzNG73fr.QX0ITO0wCMyEzNzEzW}`
``` bash
The typical need we have for documentation is just to figure out how to use all the programs, and a specific case of that is figuring out what arguments to specify on the command line.
The correct usage of programs depends, in a large part, on the proper specification of arguments to them.
Here,i had to give /challenge/challenge command with the argument --giveflag with proper documentation to get my flag.
```
### What I learned
I learned about the various ways of asking the environment for help for the programs and reading the program in different ways.

## learning complex usage
The challenge teaches me complex documentation.
**Flag** `pwn.college{QpNFOjSFXELVLybCUpIENb4ba8j.QX1ITO0wCMyEzNzEzW}`
``` bash
Many commands are analogous and require complex documentation,we will learn all that in depth later.
Here,i had to give /challenge/challenge command with the argument --printfile which in turn needed /flag argument with proper documentation to get my flag.
```
### What I learned
I learned about the argument within argument documentation.

## Reading manuals
The challenge teaches me man command
**Flag** `pwn.college{wW2yQ1zP2mzQYrwH0tQZnPIMRWL.QX0EDO0wCMyEzNzEzW}`
``` bash
This level introduces the man command. man is short for manual, and will display (if available) the manual of the command we pass as an argument.
We can scroll around the manpage with your arrow keys and PgUp/PgDn. When we are done reading the manpage, we can hit q to quit.
Here,i had to learn a secret option through the man page for challenge which i read and understood in order to invoke the /challenge/challenge with proper arguments  to get my flag.
```
### What I learned
I learned about the reading manuals using man command.

## Searching manuals
The challenge teaches searching manuals
**Flag** `pwn.college{oyTrop6qfiwGSjKA9Fr_DL3Tn1E.QX1EDO0wCMyEzNzEzW}`
``` bash
We can scroll man pages with the arrow keys (and PgUp/PgDn) and search with /. After searching, we can hit n to go to the next result and N to go to the previous result. Instead of /, we can use ? to search backwards.
Here,i had go through the man page for challenge where is used /flag to search for the argument that would give me my flag and then invoked /challenge/chllenge with the proper argument to get my flag.
```
### What I learned
I learned about the searching manuals using man command.

## Help for builtins
The challenge teaches me about buitlins
**Flag** `wn.college{sJduPsChEvOTu3dYAucW-P6RE8q.QX0ETO0wCMyEzNzEzW}`
``` bash
Some commands, rather than being programs with man pages and help options, are built into the shell itself. These are called builtins.
Builtins are invoked just like commands, but the shell handles them internally instead of launching other programs.
Here,i had  to lookup challenge's help to figure out the secret value to pass to it to get my flag.
```
### What I learned
I learned about the builtins and help command.
