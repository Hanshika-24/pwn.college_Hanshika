# Digesting Documentation
## learning from documentation
The challenge teaches me reading from documentation.
**Flag** `pwn.college{oMdoUSyxr3AJ75Hwf6ZanFZGnxy.QXxcTN0wCMyEzNzEzW}`
``` bash
The typical need we have for documentation is just to figure out how to use all the programs, and a specific case of that is figuring out what arguments to specify on the command line.
The correct usage of programs depends, in a large part, on the proper specification of arguments to them.
Here,i read the flag file in my home directory using cat.
```
### What I learned
I learned about the various ways of asking the environment for help for the programs and reading the program in different ways.
